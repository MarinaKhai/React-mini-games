# React-mini-games
Training web project to practice react basics.

Each folder is a single mini-app.

For now I've only included index.js and *.css files, not the whole react project structure.

To try these games in action simply create react app from any available template (like <code>create-react-app</code>), delete all files from /src and paste my files from a game's folder there.
